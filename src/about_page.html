        <div class="mt-6 ... flex items-center justify-center text-2xl mx-[20%]">Our project, AI for ASL, was developed with the intention of participants being able to
            learn about artificial intelligence through hands-on interaction. The project also enables users to
            learn about American Sign Language, a language that allows people to communicate through hand signals. We wanted a simple application that allows a curiosity and
            rudimentary understanding of AI to develop. The idea for our project was to create a simple
            interface where users sign ASL
            characters into a camera and the
            application will attempt to accurately
            interpret the character. We created
            two models, blue and red, that
            are each trained to recognize five
            characters. The blue model was
            trained to recognize the characters a, b, c, d, and l. The red model was trained to recognize the
            characters d, e, f, g, and i. We thought having two models would help reinforce the idea that AI
            needs to be specifically trained to complete certain tasks. The blue model isn’t going to be
            able to recognize all characters in the red model and vice versa.

        <div class="mt-6 ... flex items-center justify-center text-2xl mx-[20%]">The past few years have resulted in an explosion of artificial intelligence advances with
            the release of various large language and generative models. How society fundamentally
            operates is subject to change as a result of recent AI advancements and consequently, it has
            never been more important to teach younger generations how to ethically and effectively engage
            with AI applications. With tools like Amazon’s Alexa, recommendation algorithms on YouTube,
            and the many other AI integrated technologies which K-12 kids interact with, it’s clear there
            needs to be institutional support for AI education within the K-12 environment. Prior research
            has been done to examine and theorize what institutionalized K-12 AI education might look like,
            however progress is still being made on wide adoption of AI education. Our project aims to give
            insights towards how K-12 students learn from and engage with AI applications so more
            effective AI curricula can be developed in the future.
